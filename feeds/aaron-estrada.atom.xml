There’s never been a better time to be a filmmaker. These days, the only constraint in what you can do is your imagination and&amp;nbsp;skill.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been watching the
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FullMetaPipe"&gt;MetaPipe Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt; you know I
was at South by Southwest this&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my first time at sxsw and I have to say I was blown away by the
energy and how amazing all the people are. It was incredibly
inspirational. There is a vibe that can only be described as joy. I’m
guessing it stems from the roots of sxsw as a mostly cultural event. A
huge percentage of the people who attend are there to see new movies
and hear new music. They are there to have fun and discover new&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on an Interactive badge and my primary goal was to network. The
fact everyone was in such a great mood made breaking the ice with
complete strangers easy. I met many fantastic people and had many
great conversations about filmmaking and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VR&lt;/span&gt;. I also managed to attend
some great presentations and&amp;nbsp;speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to say what the big takeaway was from my personal perspective
it would be: &lt;strong&gt;There’s never been a better time to be a&amp;nbsp;filmmaker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gareth Edwards mentioned it in his
&lt;a href="https://www.sxsw.com/film/2017/gareth-edwards-film-keynote-speaker-2017-sxsw-conference-video/"&gt;Key Note&lt;/a&gt;
and Casey Neistat mentioned it in
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rAZyGj83gJo?t=19m9s"&gt;his speech&lt;/a&gt; as well. This is
something I’ve believed since the first &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DV&lt;/span&gt; cameras hit the market in
1995 and even more so since powerful smartphones with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HD&lt;/span&gt; cameras
became the norm. Camera technology has hit a point where even the most
modest cameras are superior to 16mm film and in some cases even older
35mm film&amp;nbsp;stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no excuses left except for the fear of&amp;nbsp;failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that in our hearts, many &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VFX&lt;/span&gt; artists are frustrated filmmakers
the way Gareth Edwards described himself when he was only doing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VFX&lt;/span&gt;
work. I know I certainly was! When I was at Dreawworks Animation, we
even had a little group called Film Club where we got together to make
48 hour films.  Some of the people in the group had &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VFX&lt;/span&gt; backgrounds,
others had only ever done animation but the common thread was we
wanted more experience with what Gareth described in his talk as “real
time rendering” through the camera. It’s a great way to practice
composition and film language &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QUICKLY&lt;/span&gt; as compared to using computer
graphics. If you haven’t experimented with cameras as a way to
practice your composition and blocking skills, I highly reccomended
it! Photography is also a great way to drive your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VFX&lt;/span&gt; work, for
example with techniques like photogrammetry, projection mapping and
tile&amp;nbsp;worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, the only constraints in what you can achieve really are
your own imagination and skill. With the cloud, even the constraints
of finite compute resources have been erased. You can think bigger.
Finding collaborators can still be a challenge but we hope to help
with that.  We want to empower people with MetaPipe in every way
possible. We started the company to help remove the technical barriers
holding back artists but as a natural benefit of working in the cloud,
remote collaboration becomes a first class feature. If you have a
dream you want to bring to fruition, contact us. We want to hear from&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sxsw"></category><category term="conference"></category><category term="inspiration"></category></entry><entry><title>Hierarchy of Needs</title><link href="http://metapipe.com/blog/posts/2017/02/28/hierarchy-of-needs/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-28T12:23:54-07:00</published><updated>2017-02-28T12:23:54-07:00</updated><author><name>Aaron Estrada</name></author><id>tag:metapipe.com,2017-02-28:/blog/posts/2017/02/28/hierarchy-of-needs/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Task list out of control?

on his personal blog. I liked it so much that I asked him if I could

You can find the link to the original article &lt;a href="http://www.misterfidget.com/blog/2017/02/27/hierarchy-of-needs.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
However, the article is posted below in its entirety. Please&amp;nbsp;enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you couldn&amp;#8217;t tell, the title of this post is a nod to
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs"&gt;&amp;#8220;Mazlow&amp;#8217;s hierarchy of needs&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;,
a psychological theory about how we prioritize things as humans. This
post isn&amp;#8217;t about that theory&amp;nbsp;whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This particular hierarchy of needs has to do with prioritizing tasks
to accomplish a goal. I am not the master goal setter in the world. I
don&amp;#8217;t claim to be some sort of planning guru. Far from it. But I have
had a thought about a simple way to deal with task lists. It has all
been inspired by conversation with my friend and colleague
&lt;a href="http://metapipe.com/team/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://blog.trello.com/why-your-to-do-list-is-going-nowhere"&gt;an article I read on Trello&amp;#8217;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the article&amp;#8217;s (and &lt;a href="http://metapipe.com/team/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AJ&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;) point
is that often our task lists aren&amp;#8217;t correlated to projects; there are
a bunch of things to get done, but they don&amp;#8217;t always drive us toward
completing our projects.  The idea is you should prioritize those
things that actually drive you closer to project completion. So, the
problem isn&amp;#8217;t your task list; it is the fact that the tasks are just
tasks, not attached to anything. I love the idea; it&amp;#8217;s something I
think most of us know, but forget far too easily. I sure know I
do. Thanks for getting me started down the path
&lt;a href="http://metapipe.com/team/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I finished the article, I thought, &amp;#8220;But how does one actually do
that? A lot of those tasks that don&amp;#8217;t push us towards our ultimate
goals and project completions are still critical things that &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to
get done.&amp;#8221; As I thought about it, I came up with a simple list to help
remind my self what my options are in such circumstances. In essence,
with any any task that doesn&amp;#8217;t drive you towards a goal, you ask
yourself if you can do one of the things listed below, in the order
listed. Do this with each task. In fact, it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be a bad idea to
do this with all your tasks, both project/goal aligned and&amp;nbsp;otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order of preferability, here are the options you should try to
apply to each task (with further explanation below): &lt;strong&gt;Eliminate&lt;/strong&gt;,
&lt;strong&gt;Automate&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Delegate&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Degenerate&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Procrastinate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can a task be outright eliminated? Can you quit a job or quit
your volunteer position in an organization that isn&amp;#8217;t driving you
towards your goal/project completion? Do you really need to add
that one extra cool feature to your
app/library/product/animation/film/game, or can you do without it
and ship it on time or earlier? Sometimes elimination just isn&amp;#8217;t
possible, but it should be our first go to; the easiest tasks to
complete are the ones you don&amp;#8217;t need to complete in the first&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a phone app, a program, a service, an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; assistant, or a
script you could use to get the task done for you without your
intervention or with minimal intervention on your part? If you are
a software developer, would it take less time to code up a solution
than it would be to do it repeatedly by hand? Some tasks are one
offs, so scripting your own solution might not make sense, but
perhaps someone else has already done the work to automate it. Even
if this costs money it is often worth it. The simple formula is to
compare your hourly wage to the cost of the product. For example,
if you are paid the Federal Minimum wage, any automated service
that can save you at least one hour of tedious work is worth $7.25
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; (the
&lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/state/stateMinWageHis.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Federal Minimum Wage as of last year, 2016&lt;/a&gt;).
Then you could spend your hour doing something more worthwhile;
like learning a new skill that will earn you more than minimum
wage.&amp;nbsp;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there someone who works for you or with you who has the
bandwidth and aptitude to accomplish the task? Will it take more
time to train the person than it would be to just do it yourself?
If it is a repeating task, perhaps the time lost training someone
else upfront can be made up in the long run (just as with
automation via&amp;nbsp;scripting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Degenerate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you sacrifice on quality? Often, 80% of the effort goes into
the last 20% of quality of a pursuit. Does the task really need to
be treated as top tier, or is it &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; to just phone it in with 20% of
the effort for 80% of the quality and save yourself a lot of time?
Confession time: I am a perfectionist. I don&amp;#8217;t mention this as some
sort of humble-brag, but with true chagrin. I either do something
with the best that I have got, or I don&amp;#8217;t do it at all. It is very
binary and very unhealthy. It means a lot of stuff that should end
up happening simply doesn&amp;#8217;t. I think a lot of other people are the
same too. Be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; with putting in less than your best to get
something less important off of your list quickly. As for me
putting this into action, I am not proof-reading this a million
times or sitting on it for multiple days like I usually do. So,
please excuse errors. Or don&amp;#8217;t. It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter because I am
posting it whether you excuse the errors or not. I&amp;#8217;m trying to be
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; with not giving 100% on this one, because it doesn&amp;#8217;t further my
most important goals and associated&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procrastinate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If worst comes to worst and you truly do need to give your level
best, can this task simply be put off for a while? I know, I know;
your mother and/or father told you to never procrastinate, but the
reality is that we do it all the time anyway without thinking about
it. The difference here is that you are doing it consciously and
purposefully. Really, another term for procrastination is
prioritization, but it just sounds far worse. Which is why I chose
it: so that both you and I will remember to actually do it! Also,
Prioritize doesn&amp;#8217;t rhyme with the other options like Procrastinate
does ;). To make it a less dirty word, let&amp;#8217;s call it Planned
Procrastination. At some point your workload is going to lighten
some and there will be time to do that one nagging thing. Of
course, all procrastinated things must eventually be done, which is
why this is the last possible option available and easily the least&amp;nbsp;desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to think of any other possibilities. Thoughts and
suggestions are welcome on this one. More options are always better. I
wrote this post for myself more than anyone. I need reminders like
this, and I like simple steps and systems I can follow. Life isn&amp;#8217;t
always so clean cut and tidy, so they end up just being guidelines,
not hard and fast rules. But even loose guidelines are better than
nothing. And with that I say, Carpe&amp;nbsp;Diem!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="repost"></category><category term="planning"></category></entry></feed>
